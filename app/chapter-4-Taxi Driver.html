<h2>Chapter 4 — Taxi Driver</h2>

<p>Across the river in Jersey City, a figure standing across the street from a coffee stand waited and as the light changed from green to red hurried across the emptying street diagonally toward a line of taxis parked outside.</p>

<p>And then, looking neither left or right with smooth motion, opened the door and got into the first cab, which had been left running.</p>

<p>Seconds later the taxi drove off and continued down the street and stopped at the next light two blocks away.</p>

<p>Just 6 blocks away Jamal’s Chicken Shack was featuring happy hour and World Cup play. It had recently reopened under new ownership. Formerly a one time a Taco Stand, and a convenience store now fried Chicken, wings, tap beer, and European football paid the rent.</p>

<p>Outside the front door, a utility pole and a phone-booth occupied the space between the diner and the street. There had been 3 booths in a row on this corner once. Two fell victim to a bus accident and were hauled away years ago. The third remained like the last lighter at a Ronald Reagan wake, disconnected, waiting for the morning that will never come. </p>

<p>Although ATT had stopped service to the phone-booth in the ’90s, it remained as a reminder of a slower time. The light still turned on when you closed the folding door.</p>

<p>“20 miles an hour ought to do it.” </p>

<p>The taxi was parked and idling a half a block back from the intersection, lights on, waiting for the stoplight to turn green with no traffic within a block.</p>

<p>As the light changed, the transmission slipped into gear and the taxi accelerated toward the utility pole.</p>

<p>“A good aim and a little luck..” </p>

<p>At 15 MPH and just across the midpoint of the intersection the car shifted into neutral, the door opened, and the driver rolled across the intersection.</p>

<p>The cab impacted the telephone pole, bounced off the pole barely pushing the phone-booth off its base on the front corner and lifting it slightly, breaking the mount holding it to the concrete slab.</p>

<p>The cab came to a rest at the curb just beyond the corner, the drivers&#8217; door wide open.</p>
