<h1>Chapter 1: “And then I came home…”</h1>

<p>Here in the hilly woods of New Jersey, it was quiet, peaceful. The city and its problems were just over the hills and across the river, but a world away.</p>

<p>It was dinner. It was a mid-week, busy work night, take out dinner.</p>

<p>They’d been married for a year. She was busy with her life, he was busy with his life, just like before the marriage but with shared laundry.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me a story.. and pass the mousse.” </p>

<p>It was her second helping of salmon; she wasn’t really hungry, but it went with the zin.</p>

<p>Dinner was an eclectic mix of takeout from a restaurant he’d passed on his way home from work. </p>

<p>It was a new place; an odd place with a Celtic name and Mediterranean themed dishes. It was his turn to shop for dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of a story&#8230;&#8221; He said.</p>

<p>Her words fought to get out in between the mouthfuls of curried something or other.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good one of course. And the &#8230;&#8221; And she pointed. Around the table there were many dishes she didn’t recognize immediately. The scents and smells hinted at the complexities of the many delicacies.</p>

<p>“This?&quot;</p>

<p>“No, the green stuff, what is that anyway&#8230;?&quot; </p>

<p>&#8220;I have no clue, “ he said as he scooped some on top of the broccoli. He looked at her and sampled a bite of it, “Its good though. Are you sure you want to spoil it?&#8221; </p>

<p>She smiled and reached for the noodles. ”Give. And that too.” She and pointed at the salad.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>She interrupted “Oh no, I get enough fairy stories at work, a story.”</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it need to have an ending?&#8221;</p>

<p>“Endings are good.. if it’s a&#8230; &quot; she was looking for the veggies.</p>

<p>He finished her sentence “.. a good ending. Are there more noodles?”</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230; over there, no the&#8230; ya, with the fork.”</p>

<p>He began. &#8220;I was at the grocer yesterday, or maybe it was Friday, anyway, the day I brought the roses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&quot;Monday, it was Monday.” She was tapping her glass lightly just below the rim with the index finger of her left hand and not blinking.</p>

<p>“Ya Monday. Could have sworn it was Friday.”</p>

<p>She stopped tapping her wineglass. </p>

<p>“…what&#8230;?&quot; He stopped eating.</p>

<p>“Nevermind&#8230; The story?&quot; She swirled the wine glass and smiled.</p>

<p>“Who said this was the story? Maybe I&#8217;m just warming up. More mousse?” He held up his glass and did the same, then took a sip. She did the same.</p>

<p>He was reaching for something, she reached for the noodles. “No, leave it.&quot; He was pointing at something she wasn&#8217;t sure was actually food. He looked at her. She twisted up her nose and shook her head.</p>

<p>&quot;Anyway, there was this car parked funny, sort of over the corner?”</p>

<p>There was a pregnant pause as he dished out noodles. The noodles were good, the green stuff she wasn’t sure.</p>

<p>“.. In The city, you know, near the park?” </p>

<p>“Thank you for the flowers.&quot; She interrupted and took a sip.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;anyway &#8230; and the engine is running, and the door is open&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>“Front or back&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>“Backdoor, passenger side, are you sure you want to hear this?&quot;</p>

<p>“Go on. You mean like right on the corner, or like off to the side.&quot;</p>

<p>“Just off to the side a little bit, like your sister parked it or something.&quot;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is my sister in this?&#8221;</p>

<p>“Well, no&#8230;&quot; he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;.. and then what.&#8221; </p>

<p>She emptied her wine glass and refilled it with another half and started to refill his. It was a Zinfandel, it needed to breathe a little more and the spiciness curled on her tongue but she gulped a mouthful and set down her glass again.</p>

<p>“.. and then I came home.&quot;</p>

<p>“What?&quot; She was grinning.</p>

<p>“Yeah, and then we had ..”.</p>

<p>“Yes, Monday, I remember,” she said. “Was that the story ?&quot;</p>

<p>“Well yeah, it got me thinking..”</p>

<p>&#8220;No wait, you can&#8217;t call that a story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking that it was unusual for that time of night, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What time was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&quot;I guess 6, maybe 6:30?“</p>

<p>“What kind of a car was it?&quot; she asked and swirled her glass before taking another sip.</p>

<p>“Black… that kind the livery companies use, they look like unmarked cop cars sort of, but with darker windows.“</p>

<p>“Oh, those. Was there a driver?&quot;</p>

<p>He shook his head. “Not that I saw, anyway..&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You want any more of this?” She screwed up her nose and held up the green stuff then scooped up the last of noodles from the container.</p>

<p>&quot;uh uh..”</p>

<p>&#8220;That it then?&#8221; she looked bored. &#8220;.. just a black car?&#8221;</p>

<p>“There was one other thing. I almost think I must have imagined it, that ever happen to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like, I dunno, it’s probably nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The phone rang.</p>

<p>&#8220;You get the phone, I&#8217;ll clean this up,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Ok,&#8230; “ He got up and walked to the kitchen. Like most people, they still had an actual wired phone line, but it never rang anymore. </p>

<p>“.. save the mousse, it’s just cold.&quot; He said.</p>

<p>He picked up the handset and pressed a button.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello&#8230;?&#8221; </p>

<p>She began by clearing the sunroom table and carried a stack of dishes to the kitchen and placed them on the marble countertop.</p>

<p>“Sure just a sec, hon it&#8217;s for you&quot;&#8230; </p>

<p>She whispered, “Who is it.&quot;</p>

<p>Whispered ”…someone named Johnson?&quot; And he set the handset down.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>&quot;ya, Hello?&#8230; speaking…” </p>

<p>&quot;I&#8217;ll get the door .. ” and he kissed her cheek as he passed on the way to the foyer.</p>

<p>She whispered “Ok&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that&#8217;s my, er, our address, who is this? What?”</p>

<p>She had green stuff on her thumb. She took the handset with her left hand and placed it next to her left ear. Someone was speaking.</p>

<p>“Pardon? Yes, that&#8217;s me, who is this?&quot;</p>

<p>At the front door, the lock turned and the street noise filtered through to the kitchen. </p>

<p>She heard “How are you doing this evening sir, were you aware that&#8230;.&quot; And he opened one of the heavy wooden doors and stepped onto the brick landing outside.</p>

<p>“Yes, my husband is here too, what is this about?”</p>

<p>She noticed her husband was no longer visible in the foyer, then the person on the phone said something on the phone she didn’t catch.</p>

<p>“What’s that? No.” She said I don’t own a truck.”</p>

<p>She heard the front door swinging on the hinges with a creak, then the gate banging on the fence.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#8217;m sorry you’ve got the wrong number. Goodbye.” </p>

<p>She hung up, distracted by the noise outside and continued clearing the sunroom table. She had a spatula and a takeout container in her hand. Next time she’d pick the restaurant she thought.</p>

<p>The rest of the takeout was going through the triage of eat, keep, toss when she realized she still heard street noise filtering in from the front door.</p>

<p>“Honey do you want any of this green stuff, there&#8217;s more in the bag.” She said loudly.</p>

<p>She scooped it into a container and looked at it at length.</p>

<p>“I have no idea what this stuff is, who would make this?” she said quietly to herself. </p>

<p>“Honey..?” she said, louder and in the direction of the foyer. She put down the container and started toward the front door.</p>

<p>In the living room she paused to look through the open front door. The front gate was open and the street visible beyond the fence.</p>

<p>A gust of wind had blown leaves and dust all over the entryway, the partially open front door creaked slightly in the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honey, who is at the door.&#8221; </p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>
