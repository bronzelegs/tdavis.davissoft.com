<h2>Chapter 2: Its Just Math</h2>

<p>Fordham University is the kind of a place one&#8217;s parents spent their college education. It had just enough marble to be chic and just enough cracked plaster to make it authentic. </p>

<p>It just before was fall break, which meant exams and actual studying for some.</p>

<p>In an apartment just off campus lived two graduate student roommates, Jake and Nick, who never studied. </p>

<p>It was fall, which mean homecoming and midterms and football all in the middle of the largest metropolitan area in North America.</p>

<p>The weather had turned colder. The leaves on the trees augmented all the human activity briefly with color changes. </p>

<p>That day one of them was 3 feet into 6 feet of dusty books at the one 4x3 desk in their room. </p>

<p>There were various other materials splNickayed across the desk. Nick was studying physics. He suspected an undergrad degree in physics wasn’t worth all that much, and he worried that a masters degree could be worth even less. </p>

<p>The door opened and his roommate Jake entered.</p>

<p>“I’ve been looking for this time warp all day, what universe is this again, I don’t recall the one where you study on a weekend.” </p>

<p>Jake picked up a thick volume. </p>

<p>&#8220;I know she doesn&#8217;t like quantum mechanics, whoever she is &#8211; what are you up to?&#8221; </p>

<p>&quot;The women that like quantum mechanics don&#8217;t have any money?” </p>

<p>“That’s sexist. There’s a party at the pub for Miller later. He passed his oral last week, you coming?&quot; </p>

<p>Grad parties were of two types, he thought; the first one you go to, and all the others. Miller had never missed a party that he could recall. </p>

<p>&quot;Can&#8217;t. I’m almost there.“ </p>

<p>“You probably will find something else to break this apparent psychotic episode.” They eyed each other.</p>

<p>“I have no time for love, just a little romance, maybe. “</p>

<p>“What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“It’s a job interview thing” He was showing him the problem he was working on. “I can’t seem to get this code worked out, no pattern that I recognize.”</p>

<p>“Could be a one-time pad. Let see.” Numbers in groups of five became letters in groups of five and continued. </p>

<p>“There is a line of numbers that don’t work with. It must be something else.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“It looks like an address but then that line that doesn’t work. “</p>

<p>“A date.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, probably.”</p>

<p>“Try the pad just on the first part leave the numbers. What is this again?”</p>

<p>They exchanged a glance, “It’s just math, mostly.”</p>

<p>“It’s complicated. They were talking about it at the bookstore. Some people say it’s a scam. I say it’s hard but I hope all this cross-disciplinary science is for some edgy startup.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stick to its just alcohol, mostly. How does this work though?” </p>

<p>“You create a login, enter answers, get the next clue and instructions. This last part I got today.”</p>

<p>“This time the instructions were encrypted and there&#8217;s was that one last bit left.”</p>

<p>“It started out ‘help from before and after’ and then this.”</p>

<p>“And then that’s an address and a that could be a date.”</p>

<p>“That’s our address. And that’s today.”</p>

<p>“How weird is that. No, it makes sense.” </p>

<p>“Try it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t right now, my laptop is charging over there.”</p>

<p>“Later&#8230; I need to shower. It doesn’t sound like any job interview I ever heard of.” His voice faded as he walked away. </p>

<p>“The questions Google asks are stupid too.”</p>

<p>Over his shoulder, his roomie said “Well, have fun. By the way, I promised Beth from the old study group we would take her out for cake on her birthday, and I can’t make it — can you handle it?”</p>

<p>“We?” He heard the closet open and close.</p>

<p>“Sure, she asked about you so I invited you. You were delighted.” He walked back through the common area and grabbed a bottled water from the counter.</p>

<p>“Maybe, but only because she’s not into you. “</p>

<p>“So you say. She’s a little too bright for me, I always feel like I need a search engine to understand what her references mean, like someone else I know”</p>

<p>“You’d rather guzzle beer with Miller all weekend or is it someone I know?”</p>

<p>“Beth’s other former roomie, but only because she’s not into you.”</p>

<p>“So you say.”</p>

<p>He tried not to look convinced.</p>

<p>“Ok, as a favor.” Jake was pressing.</p>

<p>They had discussed this commitment earlier in the week. Feigning interest while in truth he was hoping he’d be able to persuade his roommate to bow out, he was playing along.</p>

<p>He had limited social time with Sarah Elizabeth, Beth to her friends. She wasn’t a grad party type either. Her conversation seemed fine to him. </p>

<p>“Can I count on you for the tip?” </p>

<p>“Sure, beware friends demanding tips. Seriously, I think she is looking forward to it. “</p>

<p>“Ok, ok. But you owe me. Have fun this weekend.” </p>

<p>He heard the shower start.</p>

<p>He opened the laptop and logged on. He had an email from the Institute of Advanced Studies waiting in his inbox.</p>

<p>It was an invitation for a treasure hunt to complete his application. There was a link.</p>
