<h2>Chapter 3 — Cake and Quiet Reflection</h2>

<p>They were to meet at the fountain on 66th At 5 PM, the decision about where to after that was up to them. But that is not what happened totally.</p>

<p>She was there in front of the fountain looking chilled and apprehensive, the lights that were illuminating the sprays had just clicked on.</p>

<p>He saw her standing there. He smiled and walked up.</p>

<p>“Beth, how great to see you, gee it’s been too long. Sorry, Jake can’t make it. “</p>

<p>She smiled and looked at her shoes. “So it’s just us, how fun. “</p>

<p>He smiled and said softly “Really, it’s great to see you, it has been awhile.”</p>

<p>A little louder he said, “Jake left us for a beer and frat party, totally last oligarchy. Miller miraculously passed his oral. You remember Miller?”</p>

<p>“Sure. He’s from Wisconsin right?”</p>

<p>“Ya, go figure chemistry and Miller.”</p>

<p>“Silly stuff, some guys go to those parties,” she said and smiled.</p>

<p>She was fumbling through her purse, then using her phone camera for a mirror, he adjusted her makeup just a bit, more for something to do to get past the moment.</p>

<p>She was half listening when she heard.</p>

<p>“Listen I thought we’d have a little fun, but I know you hate fun .. so I wanted to be upfront about it.”</p>

<p>Chuckling.. she said “What?”.</p>

<p>“Trust me, you’ll never regret our little evening of quiet reflection and cake.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you mention fun?”</p>

<p>“..and fun. Loads of fun. Literally more fun than you can have in this state without a note from your parents.”</p>

<p>“Oh-kay, you’re on — let me see if I brought my heart pills, yep check, check and check. “</p>

<p>They were standing there on the plaza, less than a foot apart. Her hair blew and tickled his face. </p>

<p>She was playing along “Let’s go.” She said.</p>

<p>They began walking up Broadway. </p>

<p>For a moment they just walked, the sound of traffic in the city and the sound of heels on uneven concrete. </p>

<p>Ahead there was a rough patch where the rain, sun, and compression had crushed the center of a section of the sidewalk. Her steps grew a little irregular on the loose pavement and crumbled concrete. </p>

<p>In the store window to her right, he caught a look as she teetered on one foot then another when a stone turned her heel.</p>

<p>They made a slight turn and then took two more steps to the curb.</p>

<p>He said “lets grab a taxi?” and raised his right arm.</p>

<p>It was just about 6 and traffic was a river of yellow taxis up and down every street. Most of the duty lights were off.</p>

<p>Usually, the subway was how they got around. Taxis were slow, but a little less public but whenever it seemed like a taxi was just what you wanted it was impossible to find one. </p>

<p>Tonight they were lucky. Just ahead a cab door opened and a couple exited. In a quick few steps, they were inside.</p>

<p>As the door shut behind them it started to rain a little.</p>

<p>“Driver, please just takes us up Fifth Avenue, when we get close I’ll let you know.” </p>

<p>“I won’t go to Harlem.” The driver didn’t look like he would take an argument on this.</p>

<p>“No, we’ll get out before then.”</p>

<p>“So, what are we doing?” She asked with a smile.</p>

<p>“We’re going on an adventure, if you agree.”</p>

<p>The driver interrupted.</p>

<p>“There&#8217;s some big do on Fifth Avenue just so you know, traffic is lighter on second.”</p>

<p>“Fifth please, it’s a nicer ride.”</p>

<p>“You got it.”</p>
