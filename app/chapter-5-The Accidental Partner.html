<h2>Chapter 5 — The Accidental Partner</h2>

<p>Fifth Avenue in fall after a rainfall was a thing of beauty. This afternoon they’d had enough of a shower to make the street sparkle in the headlights.</p>

<p>They passed corner after corner crowded with people in a rush to be somewhere warm and dry. The cold gave the evening an edge and kept the couples out for dinner huddled close.</p>

<p>The sound of water splashing against the taxis where water had gathered in places at corners and clogged rain sewers interrupted the silence.</p>

<p>He turned his head to look at her.</p>

<p>She began “What have you been up to lately? I’ve been so busy with the internship I sort of lost track of the study group.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m working on more unmarketable letters after my name. The challenge of pursuing a career that has no jobs; either settle for something you are just a little overqualified for or keep going, which makes you a lot overqualified.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know. “</p>

<p>“How about you, still political science?”</p>

<p>“Sort of. I’m hoping my internship leads to something great. I want to stay here in the city, I love the bustle.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been doing the interview circuit, and hoping to wrap up my dissertation in the spring.” </p>

<p>She didn’t want to talk about work. “Any prospects you are hopeful about?”</p>

<p>He smiled, “I’ve been doing this interview thing which I might pan out, it’s a real long shot for sure though. Which is sort of..”</p>

<p>“Oh? Tell me about it.”</p>

<p>“It&#8217;s posting on InLink. A really unusual posting for a job on with a startup. Jake has been helping here and there.“</p>

<p>“Like what kind of a startup?” </p>

<p>He smiled “ A real mixed bag of wave theory and chemistry questions and exercises.“</p>

<p>“And I must have passed because they sent me an email inviting me to a treasure hunt. So I’m thinking like a little adventure, you know a culture kind of thing.”</p>

<p>“Go on. So what do you need to do?”</p>

<p>“Simple stuff, recover some objects, follow instructions and just go with the flow, blah blah. It’s like 3 things. ”</p>

<p>“Sounds kind of fun. ”</p>

<p>“It’s on the way, sort of, If you want to, I mean if you’re into it. It might take a while, but its simple stuff.”</p>

<p>“So sure, we can do that.” She was smiling. “When can we start ?”</p>

<p>“We can start now. First thing is this address on Fox over by the freeway. Find this office, look for clues.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go.”</p>

<p>“Ok driver, we’ll get out here please.” </p>
