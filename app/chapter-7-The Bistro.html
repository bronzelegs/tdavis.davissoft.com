<h2>Chapter 7 — The Bistro</h2>

<p>The bistro was just across the street. They stood stopped at the curb while waiting for the light. A car with a woman and her children in car seats in the back turned left with the green.</p>

<p>The bistro was dimly lit, warm and nearly empty.</p>

<p>“Bonjour. Table for two?&quot; She said in English, but it sounded more French than English when she spoke it. </p>

<p>Marie, the hostess, turned immediately and led them past several tables then stopped at one with an outlet. </p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Is good?&#8221; Marie was already placing the menus and lighting the candle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, this is fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>They ordered coffee and held the menus as Marie stepped away and took her place at the far end of the bar.</p>

<p>After a pregnant pause, she asked, &#8220;What are we doing again?&#8221; </p>

<p>&quot;Like I said, first things first. I&#8217;ll be right back.”</p>

<p>He walked toward the far end of the bar.</p>

<p>Marie was still noting the coffee on the pad as he approached and looked up. &#8220;Was there something?&#8221;</p>

<p>Beth struggled with all the events of the evening, not enough pieces to a puzzle with the image on the back.</p>

<p>The waitress Vivienne brought the coffee, smiled, and walked back to the kitchen. The coffee was strong and needed cream.</p>

<p>She reached for her phone. </p>

<p>No messages. </p>

<p>She’d forgotten about the package. There it was in her tote.</p>

<p>“Cream and sugar?” Vivienne the waitress caught her off guard. She looked up and put her phone away. </p>

<p>“Would you like I wait?” </p>

<p>“Wait? Oh yes, give us a sec.”</p>

<p>At the end of the bar, Marie was writing something down and looked back at the table and smiled at her then walked toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>This was no way to spend your birthday she thought. Her shoes would never be the same and her feet hurt. </p>

<p>&#8220;There, all set.&#8221; He returned and sat across from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that car following us?&#8221; She asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure, I think it’s gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&quot;What is that, that, whatever we got in the office.”</p>

<p>“All I know is, find this address look for the package, take it and the note. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“I thought you said it was just math, there’s more to it than that obviously.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I had to decipher that and find the keys, not as easy it looks. But seriously, like a treasure hunt as far as I know.”</p>

<p>“There should be something on the paper that we picked up to help with the next one.”</p>

<p>She looked a little skeptical.</p>

<p>“And I don&#8217;t know what that package is, I saw that guy drop it though as he passed and right there and I guess I got caught up in the moment.” He said.</p>

<p>She was reading the note from the item in the office.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?” He said.</p>

<p>“It has today&#8217;s date on it, and an address is written on the back and some other stuff 1956 and a Chinese character of something.”</p>

<p>“The note from the office?” </p>

<p>“Yes. I had to work it out. It was written in English. Who knew?” </p>

<p>“As I said, first things first. Cake and a little quiet reflection.”</p>

<p>“Bring on the cake. Or is there more quiet reflection?” </p>

<p>“Seriously, it’s just an accident or something, and that car was just a lady and her kids.”</p>

<p>“It’s ok, I guess I wasn’t expecting this much of an adventure. I wonder what it really was though, you’re right it’s probably nothing.”</p>

<p>“You have your heart pills.”</p>

<p>She laughed. “You’re funny. Ok, it has been fun. And I love a mystery.”</p>

<p>Just then Marie and the Vivienne brought two slices of semi-sweet chocolate cake with a few candles and two flutes of champagne.</p>

<p>“They didn’t have cherry pie and ice cream.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make do.”</p>

<p>“Bon Anniversaire!”</p>

<p>The cake was half sweet, the Champagne was too. </p>

<p>“The last time we had cake it was the chocolate cake and cherry coke bar our study group sponsored last New Years.”</p>

<p>“It was energy drinks mixed with Kaluha and Baileys over ice .. and s’mores.”</p>

<p>“No way.” </p>

<p>“Way.”</p>

<p>“Is that any good?”</p>

<p>She laughed. “Not really.”</p>

<p>“They ran out of cake by 10. Plan B. By then it didn’t really matter.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember that at all.”</p>

<p>They both laughed.</p>

<p>“I always thought you’d end up running for something.” She said.</p>

<p>“Me, politics?” </p>

<p>“I’d vote for you. And I can think of at least one other person I could persuade to vote for you too,” she said.</p>

<p>“You were the political science major, not me.” He said.</p>

<p>“I never got the bug I guess. Someone once said, it’s not a sign on a door that makes a leader.”</p>

<p>“Who was that?” He asked.</p>

<p>“You.”</p>

<p>“Silly me. One of us needs to change the world, obviously the rest of the world is busy. I was hoping it was you.”</p>

<p>“You underestimate people.”</p>

<p>“Not usually. We’re used to getting to the bottom of things. Most of the world hasn’t got that kind of time.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s up to us.”</p>

<p>“Ok, as long as there’s cake at the end. I’ll do anything for cake, obviously.”</p>

<p>“I think I can arrange that.”</p>

<p>They talked and shared cake and after a while she took a deep breath. With a sigh she slipped off her shoes and just looked at him for a full minute while chasing some icing around on her plate with her fork.</p>

<p>“To you on your birthday.” He said.</p>

<p>“To many more.” </p>

<p>She decided it was a good birthday. </p>
