<h2>Chapter 6 : Fox Street</h2>

<p>The taxi dropped them off at the corner a few blocks away. The mapping app on their phone led them to a small refurbished warehouse converted to an office building.</p>

<p>There was retail space on the ground floor, now unoccupied, and an archway leading to a double entrance.</p>

<p>Inside the entrance, just a block of mailboxes and a stairway leading up.</p>

<p>“There are no names on any of these mailboxes.” She said.</p>

<p>He was looking at his phone.</p>

<p>“Which one ?” He wondered out loud. “The clue is ‘KP4 to KP6 when one door closes another opens.’” </p>

<p>“What’s that mean?” </p>

<p>“I have no idea.”</p>

<p>“That’s an illegal move in chess.”</p>

<p>“I know, maybe it means something else.”</p>

<p>The stairway led them up to a corridor. Along the second floor a row of office suites, each alike, lining either side of the hallway. There was a door slightly ajar just ahead. </p>

<p>“Is that it?” </p>

<p>“I think so.“ </p>

<p>“Now what?”</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look.”</p>

<p>The office was a suite, a small outer office with a small desk, and an inner private office through a door behind it. The inner door was open half way. </p>

<p>She spoke softly “Are you sure this is ok?”</p>

<p>“Well, this is the address, it’s the open door. I guess if we see a note we are in the right place.”</p>

<p>He opened the door and said “Hello?” to no answer and they stepped inside.</p>

<p>They listened for a few seconds, then moved into the inner office.</p>

<p>The inner office had a sofa, two chairs along one wall and a large wooden desk with a chair opposite it. On the desk was a note and a small package.</p>

<p>She picked up the note.</p>

<p>“It says..”</p>

<p>‘One thing about being chased, you start to know the rabbit.’</p>

<p>There was something written on the back too; the back of the note was stained, washed out and faded. </p>

<p>She said, “Looks like a time, and a location. There is also a Chinese character or something and a box.”</p>

<p>&#8220;What do these symbols mean?&#8221; She showed him the note.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221; </p>

<p>There was a sound in the outer office. </p>

<p>&quot;What was that?”, she said.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#8217;m not sure. Let’s step out.”</p>

<p>There was a door to the corridor behind the desk. In a second they were through it.</p>

<p>The light clicked on as they closed the door quietly behind them. The second entrance to the suite led from the inner office by a narrow stairwell that led out to the street on the other side of the building.</p>

<p>The door at the foot of the staircase wasn’t locked. They paused there. The street was visible, and a crowd was gathering.</p>

<p>A man carrying roses and groceries was hurrying past and dropped something.</p>

<p>They slipped out and stood motionless along the side of the building as the crowd gathered and moved past them.</p>

<p>There was a black car with the back door open parked over the corner at the end of the block.</p>

<p>And just in front of the vending machine on the sidewalk a package the man passing had dropped.</p>

<p>“What should we do? “</p>

<p>The traffic was slowing and the sidewalk was clearing as the crowd edged its way closer to the corner.</p>

<p>“Pick it up obviously. Go with the flow.”</p>

<p>“What? “</p>

<p>In the distance a siren broke the moment, it was coming closer.</p>

<p>“Are you mad.. Let’s get out of here,” she said. </p>

<p>With that and a quick finesse on the sidewalk, they were around the corner.</p>

<p>It was a small box inside a FedEx envelope with a piece of paper secured around it with a rubber band.</p>

<p>“Hang on.”</p>

<p>“It says ‘Happy Birthday’”</p>

<p>“Anything else?” </p>

<p>They exchanged glances.</p>

<p>“What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>“Today is my birthday.”</p>

<p>“I know, what else does it say?&quot; </p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, it’s a receipt.&#8221; Inside an overly large half sheet of paper folded in half was the address of the shop on Fifth Avenue at the top.</p>

<p>”Should we open it?&quot;</p>

<p>“Now ?“ </p>

<p>She felt conspicuous and started walking up the street. </p>

<p>“Come on.”</p>

<p>They continued up the block and crossed the street walked back away from the commotion. When they were far enough away they stopped and looked at each other.</p>

<p>“Um, sorry but what going on here, what have you gotten us into?”</p>

<p>He hesitated, “I uh. I’m just going with the flow.”</p>

<p>She tugged his sleeve and looked up the street and tilted her head in that direction. A car passed slowly and turned left as they waited for the light.</p>

<p>“First things first, is there a coffee shop around?&quot;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a bistro on the corner or a taco stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>A half block ahead and across the street, there was a car with its lights off. </p>

<p>&#8220;Is that anyone you know?&#8221; </p>

<p>The stopped waiting for the light to change. It was starting to drizzle. The street looked wet and smooth, glistening red in the traffic light. As the light changed green they started to cross. </p>

<p>“This feels funny.”</p>

<p>As they turned toward the bistro, a shadow in the car stirred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s just go ask what they want.&#8221; </p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d do, and that’s not working out so well so far today.&#8221;</p>

<p>The car’s headlights cut the dark.</p>

<p>It started to rain a little. </p>

<p>They made their way up the block toward the Bistro in the light rain.</p>

<p>The headlights followed them then turned at the corner to the left and disappeared down the street.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’re a little bit jumpy.” </p>

<p>“Maybe.” She was on edge. </p>

<p>“You love it, when was the last time you had this much fun on your birthday?” </p>

<p>“Let’s get out of the rain before it picks up.” She said.</p>

<p>The bistro was just ahead.</p>
